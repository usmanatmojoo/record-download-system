# record-download-system
This web-based system is useful as a one-page landing page that displays some information from the company and is useful for recording visitors, besides this web system is useful for visitors who want to take brochures for further purposes with the company, namely by downloading an information brochure file about the company, to download. The file is asked visitors to fill in their personal data for recording visitor data.

- This system is created using html, native php, js, css, and bootstrap, the templates used in this web system are taken from colorlib as a reference in building this web system. I didn't remove the credit from the Colorlib to appreciate the original developer's work. thank you and enjoy ^ _ ^
